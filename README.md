# RE:SOUND CONFERENCE APP #

Conference app for [RE:SOUND Media Arts Histories 2019 Conference](http://www.mediaarthistory.org/resound) in Aalborg, Denmark. 

It's a conference navigation app, with an added conceptual component: an interactive/collaborative art archive that allows conference goers to collaborate with the conference art exhibition digital archive.
